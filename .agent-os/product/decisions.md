# Key Decisions

## Architectural Decisions

### Frontend Framework: React + TypeScript
**Decision**: Use React 18 with TypeScript for the frontend
**Rationale**: 
- React provides excellent component reusability and ecosystem
- TypeScript adds type safety and better developer experience
- Large community and mature tooling
- Excellent performance with modern React features

### Build Tool: Vite
**Decision**: Use Vite instead of Create React App or Webpack
**Rationale**:
- Significantly faster development server and builds
- Modern ES modules support
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Better developer experience with HMR

### UI Component Library: shadcn/ui
**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI
**Rationale**:
- Copy-paste approach gives full control over components
- Built on accessible Radix UI primitives
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Customizable and themeable
- No runtime dependency on external packages

### Styling: TailwindCSS
**Decision**: Use TailwindCSS for styling
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Excellent integration with React components
- Built-in responsive design utilities
- Consistent design system
- Great developer experience with VS Code extension

### State Management: React Query + React Hook Form
**Decision**: Use React Query for server state, React Hook Form for form state
**Rationale**:
- React Query handles caching, synchronization, and background updates
- React Hook Form provides excellent performance and DX for forms
- Zod integration for type-safe validation
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux

### Routing: React Router
**Decision**: Use React Router DOM for client-side routing
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for React applications
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Flexible and feature-complete
- Good integration with modern React patterns

## Development Decisions

### Package Manager: npm
**Decision**: Primary package manager is npm (with bun.lockb also present)
**Rationale**:
- Stable and widely supported
- Good integration with most tools
- Note: bun.lockb suggests bun was also tested/used

### Code Quality: ESLint + TypeScript
**Decision**: Use ESLint with TypeScript ESLint rules
**Rationale**:
- Catches common errors and enforces consistent code style
- TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
- Good integration with VS Code and other editors

### Development Platform: Lovable.dev
**Decision**: Built for/with Lovable.dev platform
**Rationale**:
- Provides rapid prototyping and development capabilities
- Good integration with modern React development workflow
- Allows for quick iteration and deployment

## Future Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Consider implementing lazy loading for routes
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Accessibility
- Radix UI provides good foundation, but need to ensure proper implementation
- Regular accessibility audits
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Testing Strategy
- Need to implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Consider React Testing Library for component tests
- E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress

### Backend Integration
- API design and integration strategy needs definition
- Consider GraphQL vs REST API approach
- Real-time features may need WebSocket implementation
